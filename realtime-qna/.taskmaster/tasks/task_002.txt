# Task ID: 2
# Title: Supabase Project and Database Schema Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Supabase project, configure PostgreSQL schema for users, questions, and votes, and enable Row Level Security (RLS).
# Details:
Define tables: users, questions (id, content, author_id, created_at, updated_at), votes (id, question_id, user_id). Enable RLS policies to restrict question edit/delete to owners and voting to authenticated users. Use supabase MCP for schema and API generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations via Supabase dashboard. Attempt unauthorized actions to verify RLS enforcement.
