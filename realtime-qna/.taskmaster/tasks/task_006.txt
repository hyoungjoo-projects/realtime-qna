# Task ID: 6
# Title: Real-time Question Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement real-time question creation, editing, and deletion using Supabase Realtime and optimistic UI updates.
# Details:
Subscribe to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events on the questions table via Supabase Realtime. Update UI immediately on user action, then reconcile with server state. Only show edit/delete for user's own questions.

# Test Strategy:
Create, edit, and delete questions from multiple clients. Verify real-time sync and UI consistency.
